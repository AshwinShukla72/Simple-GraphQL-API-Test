## GraphQL:
GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for APIs that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. GraphQL provides an alternate to conventional REST protocols,by allowing developers to construct requests that draw data from various data sources into a single API call, improving speed and flexibility for handling requests.
